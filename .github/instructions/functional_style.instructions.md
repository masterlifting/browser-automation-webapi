I'm from F#.
In this repository, we prefer a functional programming style. 
This means that we encourage the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions. 
- Favor pure functions over side-effecting ones.
- Use immutable data structures and avoid mutable state.
- Compose small, single‐purpose functions to build complex behavior.
- Pass functions as values for customization instead of using OO interfaces.
- Avoid explicit loops; use sequence operations like `List.map`, `List.filter`, `Seq.fold`, etc.
- Keep functions small and focused on one responsibility.
- Use pattern matching for branching and deconstruction.
- Leverage higher‐order functions to eliminate boilerplate and improve reuse.
- Embrace recursion (tail‐recursion when needed) over mutable iteration.
- Use function currying to create specialized functions from general ones.
- Prefer declarative constructs over imperative ones.
- Use type inference to reduce boilerplate and improve readability.
- Use algebraic data types (ADTs) to model complex data structures.
- Use modules to group related functions and types.
- Use function composition to build complex functions from simpler ones.
- Use function pipelines to chain operations together.
